# Clustering

## 1. Exploration
```
$ python exploration.py
```

## 2. Exploration
### 2.1 Code
```
$ python kmeans.py digits-embedding.csv 10
```
### 2.2 Analysis
For 2.1 and 2.2, run with the command belowe to get the plot showing the within-cluster sum of squared distances (WC SSD) and silhouette coefficient (SC) as a function of K.
```
$ python kmeans-analysis_2_12.py
```
For 2.3, run with the following command to get the average and standard deviation (for WC SSD and SC) for the dfferent values of K.
```
$ python kmeans-analysis_2_3.py
```
For 2.4, run with the following command to get the NMI for the choice of K in Step 2 and the visualization.
```
$ python kmeans-analysis_2_4.py
```
## 3. Hierarchical Clustering
For all 5 questions in Question 3, run the following command to get all the results.
```
$ python clustering.py
```
